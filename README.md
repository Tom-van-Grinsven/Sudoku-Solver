# Sudoku Solver

A project to practice with the backtracking algorithm. This solver takes a Sudoku from [this public API](https://github.com/berto/sugoku) and tries to
solve it using the backtracking algorithm. 

# GUI

A GUI has not yet been added, so this project is a WIP until I decide to work on it again. Possible features
could be implementing a GUI with pygame that makes playing a Sudoku possible, along with a visual representation of the
backtracking algorithm doing it's "magic".
